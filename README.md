# üè† Personal Homelab Infrastructure

## Overview
This repository documents my homelab infrastructure, which serves as a practical demonstration of my DevOps skills and experience. The lab is built around a Beelink Mini PC Sei12 running Proxmox VE as the hypervisor, hosting various virtual machines and containers for different services.

## Hardware Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Model | Beelink Mini PC Sei12 |
| CPU | Intel Core i5-1235U |
| RAM | 16GB DDR4 |
| Storage | 500GB NVMe SSD |
| Network | 1GbE Ethernet |
| Hypervisor | Proxmox VE |

## Infrastructure Components

### Virtual Machines and Containers

| Name | Type | IP Address | Description |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| Pihole | LXC Container | Internal | Network-wide DNS and Ad-blocking solution |
| Traefik | LXC Container | 192.168.0.100 | Reverse proxy for service routing and SSL termination |
| CasaOS | VM | 192.168.0.190 | Personal cloud platform for self-hosted applications |
| K3s Master | VM | 192.168.0.230 | Kubernetes cluster master node running K3s and ArgoCD |
| K3s Worker 1 | VM | 192.168.0.231 | Kubernetes cluster worker node |
| K3s Worker 2 | VM | 192.168.0.232 | Kubernetes cluster worker node |
| Boxofmanythings | VM | Internal | Development environment with tools and utilities |

## Kubernetes Cluster Details
The K3s cluster provides a lightweight Kubernetes distribution with the following features:
- Simplified installation and maintenance
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment
- Automated application deployment and management
- Built-in load balancing

## Installation Procedures

### Proxmox VE Setup
1. Downloaded Proxmox VE ISO
2. Created bootable USB
3. Installed on Beelink Mini PC
4. Configured network settings
5. Set up web interface access

### Proxmox Post Install
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/misc/post-pve-install.sh)"
```

### Container Deployments

#### Pihole
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/pihole.sh)"
```

#### Traefik
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/traefik.sh)"
```

### Virtual Machine Deployments

#### K3s Cluster
```bash
# Master node installation
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# Worker nodes
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://192.168.0.230:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<node-token> sh -

# ArgoCD Installation
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Regular backup procedures
- Performance monitoring
- Security updates and patches

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement cluster monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- [ ] Add automated backup solution
- [ ] Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform
- [ ] Add network security monitoring
